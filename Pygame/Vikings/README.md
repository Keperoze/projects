This project is just a free-time learning process. On 2023.03.01 I started learning pygame and I want to see how far I can go. 
I am planning to create a strategy game, using only the resources that are available online for free.

2023.03.12 - created a basic Tiled background, imported the three warrior idle sprites and animated their idle positions.  
2023.03.17 - implemented the selection box logic.  
2023.03.18 - implemented hitpoint logic above unit sprites when selected.  
2023.03.19 - implemented basic movement. Selected units move towards mouse when right-clicked.  
2023.03.21 - implemented collision logic between units. Units don't bunch up in a single spot. Added multiple status animations to warrior sprites.  

NEXT STEPS:
- figure out a way to move in formations (probably a .csv file with numbered spots based on number of selected units)
- basic enemy behaviour
- pathfinding
